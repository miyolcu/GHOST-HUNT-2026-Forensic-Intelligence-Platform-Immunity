# GHOST HUNT 2026: Forensic Intelligence & Platform Immunity 🛡️🔍

## 🛡️ Project Overview
**GHOST HUNT 2026** is an individual forensic investigation into a massive inorganic influence operation. By processing a dataset of **42.1 Million tweets**, I deconstructed the "mechanical heartbeat" of a sophisticated hybrid network that mimics organic human behavior to bypass platform security filters.

## 🔍 Core Findings
* **Mechanical Rhythm (1000ms):** My analysis revealed tens of thousands of accounts operating with a perfect **1000ms (1 second)** synchronization—a clear indicator of non-organic, automated activity.
* **Forensic Confidence (99.8%):** Using high-precision synchronization tests, the inorganic nature of this flow was verified with a **99.8% confidence interval**.
* **Global Distribution:** Mapped critical hub nodes originating from **Istanbul (182K nodes)**, London, and New York, identifying a global proxy-based infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Technical Engine & Architecture
This project leverages high-performance computing (HPC) and custom forensic scripts to process large-scale social data.
* **Hardware:** 56-Thread Xeon Architecture (E5-2680 High-Performance Engine).
* **Methodology:** Parallel data mining, temporal variance analysis, and API layer unmasking.
* **Tech Stack:** Python 3.x, Asynchronous Data Processing, Network Graphing.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **`/src`**: The forensic engine including `analyze_parallel.py` and `06_network_synchronicity.py`.
* **`/reports`**: Detailed forensic audit reports (PDF/DOCX) in English and Turkish.
* **`/visuals`**: Data visualizations including pathology reports and timezone heatmaps.

## 📊 API & Source Attribution
The investigation identified that the traffic was masked through professional social media management layers:
* **Zoho Social:** 12.6M Tweets
* **CryptoMatic:** 8.8M Tweets
* **eNgageCXM:** 6.3M Tweets

## 📜 Proposed Immunity Doctrine
To protect digital ecosystems from such algorithmic swarm attacks, I propose a pro-active defense model based on:
1.  **Temporal Entropy Filtering**
2.  **Behavioral Fingerprinting**
3.  **Cross-Regional Hub Isolation**
